Located between Ocala and Ormond Beach along SR 40, this complex of swimming and picnic area, campground, and trails was constructed in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The setting is unlike any other found in the United States, with hundreds of tiny bubbling springs and massive springs gushing out of crevices in the earth beneath a dense canopy of palms and oaks, an oasis within the heart of the desert-like Big Scrub."

The 596-acre peninsular park also protects valuable coastal habitat and ecological communities that include mangrove forests, salt marshes, freshwater marshes, coastal hammocks, and pine flatwoods. The Upper Tampa Bay Park offers an abundance of wildlife and other ecological treasures for any devoted nature lover. Visitors can take a hike on nature trails and boardwalks and see gopher tortoises, zebra swallowtail butterflies, and even bobcats. They can also check out the shallow fresh water ponds that provide habitat for aquatic plants and animals. Live oaks and other hardwood trees often grow near these wetlands, where red shouldered hawks and bald eagles are sometimes seen. The shoreline and waters attract park wildlife and many other species, including roseate spoonbills, ospreys, otters, bottle nosed dolphins, and manatees. But the fun doesn’t stop with the nature walks. The park’s canoe/kayak launch provides access to the creek and bay, which are excellent places for game fish, including red drum and snook. And while adults can relax and have lunch at the picnic shelters and tables, children can enjoy the park’s centrally located playground. The park also has a nature center which not only contains interpretive exhibits that describe the park environment, history, and geology, but also live animal displays that houses fish, snakes, and turtles."
